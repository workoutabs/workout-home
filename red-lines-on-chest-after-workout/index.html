<p>Red dots on the chest skin after bench press can be caused by bench-induced allergies. This reaction can occur without provocation or may develop as the circulatory system speeds up during exercise and picks up bits of an allergen eaten prior to bench. I benchpress every other work out session. The symptoms are hives or spots large or small itching of the skin flushing redness of the skin and this can occur anywhere on the body other than the chest. Ive been working out for a month or so now 3 times a week.</p>
