<p>I often take breaks and drink water on floor. I am so slow on the floor. I want to create a sheet of all the things we do on the floor and a quick explanation so I can pick a body part and do those sets of exercises. Question - I have seen some spreadsheet gurus in here and I wonder if anyone out there happens to track some of our floor exercises. Your coaches would should rather see 6 or 7 PERFECT reps rather than 5 mediocre reps and 5 sloppy reps because you wore yourself out just trying to get to 10.</p>
