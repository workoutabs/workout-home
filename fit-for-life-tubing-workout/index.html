<p>I just started the Fit For Life Tubing Workout this week so all I can say is I like it. I start with the videos and do the 5 reps of each exercise with Jenna to learn the exercise then start over and do 2 sets of each of the Getting Started and Healthy Workout exercises. Now you can obtain a super-fast full-body workout. Im 71 years old and the work out so far has proven challenging but Im really enjoying it. My program the Fit For Life Tubing Workout was designed for health-conscious people like you who lead extremely busy lives and dont have time to hit the gym. No matter how hectic your schedule is.
