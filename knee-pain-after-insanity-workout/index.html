Today it hit first day of 2nd week after rest day and i cant seem to do any kind of squat power jumps because of knee pain. I did the program about three years ago LOVED it but wasnt able to complete the last week because I couldnt handle the pain in my knee anymore. Pin On Health And Fitness Äº.</p>

<p>Knee Pain Insanity Workout. From that point on I still have troubles with my knee and have to be so careful with what exercises. I want to give my honest review of Shaun Ts Insanity program. Knee pain after insanity workout. Luckily week 5 is a recovery week and the workouts. I am a runner and very use to the impact it has on your knees but have never experience this pain in my knee.
