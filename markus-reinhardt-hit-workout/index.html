<p>Markus believes in High Intensity Training HIT just the way the old hard core guys trained to perform 6-10 repetitions per set for upper body movements and 10-20 reps for lower body ones. Let me first of all tell you guys that HIT was not the only way I trained since i started bodybuilding. Markus believes in High Intensity Training HIT just the way the old hard core guys trained to perform 6-10 repetitions per set for upper body movements and 10-20 reps for lower body ones. Chest delts and triceps on one day legs and calves for the second day followed by a back and biceps workout. The workouts usually consisted of hitting. But it sure is the ONLY WAY for me to train now after I was lucky enough to meet my mentor and friend Mike Mentzer in the late 90s. Markus Reinhardt Mrhighintensity Posts Facebook.</p>
